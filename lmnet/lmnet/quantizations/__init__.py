r"""This Package provides a set of quantizations.

How to use:

.. code-block:: python

    quantizer = binary_mean_scaling_quantizer() # initialize quantizer
    weights = tf.get_variable("kernel", shape=[1, 2, 3, 4]) # prepare variavle.
    quantized_weights = quantizer(weights) # use quantizer to quantize variable
    tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, quantized_weights)

Methods:
    linear_mid_tread_half_quantizer
    binary_mean_scaling_quantizer
    binary_channel_wise_mean_scaling_quantizer
    ttq_weight_quantizer
    twn_weight_quantizer
